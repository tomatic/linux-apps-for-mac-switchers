# Linux Apps for Mac Switchers

Not long ago, switching from Windows to the Mac was quite en vogue. The Mac seemed friendlier, Mac developers seemingly put more thought into the apps they created and Mac users felt more productive on the Mac than on Windows.

While all of that may still hold true in 2019, the Mac seems to be headed down a path of which many long-time Mac users are growing increasingly sceptical. macOS seems to be getting more and more like iOS and true gains in productivity and usability from one major release to the next have become few and far between. Productivity and usability often even take a hit in new releases of macOS due to newly introduced "features", changes or restrictions. Add to that an overall decline in Apple's software quality, which has led an increasing number of Mac users to grow frustrated with the platform they once loved and start looking for an alternative.

If you are one of these Mac users and you don't want to go back to Windows, you might want to consider switching to Linux. To help with that switch, here you'll find a curated list of apps that can replace the apps you've been using on the Mac.

This list is a work in progress. Feel free to contribute via a pull request.
